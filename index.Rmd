# Overview {-}

This course was developed at the request of Michael Thom who stated that

> We have a fairly small team and are looking for a one-day crash course in sample size calculation methods and considerations (power analysis). 
> We all have a basic understanding of stats and how to program in R, so the team would be able to jump right into this focused topic.

As requested the course focuses on frequentist methods and power analysis although it begins with a broader introduction to Bayesian methods and effect sizes.

## Materials {-}

This booklet is available at

<https://poisson-dfosamplestatsbook.netlify.app>

password *salmonids*.

There is a currently private R data package associated with the book which is available at

<https://github.com/poissonconsulting/DFOsalmonids>

and a currently private R package of simple analytic functions at

<https://github.com/poissonconsulting/DFOsamplestats>

although the website describing the functions is available at <https://poissonconsulting.github.io/DFOsamplestats/>.

Following the course, a hosting fee will be charged after six months unless the book and the R packages are transferred to the [DFO github](https://github.com/dfo-mpo) site.

## Users {-}

This booklet was written to be a teaching guide for a one day crash course (taught as two half days).
As such the booklet will be most useful for course participants both during and after the course.

The booklet is not expected to be useful to researchers who have not taken the course especially if they little understanding of statistics and/or R.
