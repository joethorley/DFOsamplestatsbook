## Installation

R is open source statistical software that can be downloaded from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).

Once R has been installed the two R packages associated with this course can be installed by running the following code in the R console.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("poissonconsulting/DFOsalmonids")
pak::pak("poissonconsulting/DFOsamplestats")
```

The packages can then be loaded using

```{r}
library(DFOsalmonids)
library(DFOsamplestats)
```

## Data Package

The `DFOsalmonids` data package provides two data sets both provided by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans.

The first is catch and release data.

```{r}
library(tibble)

DFOsalmonids::salmonids
```

The second scale age data.

```{r}
DFOsalmonids::scale_age
```

## Analytic Package

The `DFOsamplestats` R package provides wrapper functions to perform simple frequentist p-value estimation and power analyses.
